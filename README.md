# 🚀 Canny Edge Detector from Scratch (C++)

A **complete implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm from scratch in C++**,  
built **without using OpenCV or any external image-processing library**.

This project focuses on **low-level image processing**, **algorithmic clarity**, and  
a **modular C++ build system**, making it suitable for **embedded systems and FPGA workflows**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Pure C++ implementation (no OpenCV)
- ✅ Gaussian Blur (noise reduction)
- ✅ Scharr-based gradient computation
- ✅ Gradient magnitude & direction
- ✅ Non-Maximum Suppression (edge thinning)
- ✅ Double Thresholding
- ✅ Hysteresis edge tracking
- ✅ Morphological refinement (dilation + erosion)
- ✅ Modular pipeline with static library build

---

## 🧠 Why this project?

Most edge-detection examples simply call:
```cpp
cv::Canny(...)
```

This project rebuilds the entire Canny pipeline from scratch, demonstrating a deep understanding of:
* Image matrices
* Convolution & filtering
* Gradient math
* Edge connectivity
* System-level C++ design

## 🛠️ Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- GCC/G++ compiler
- Make (optional)
- Basic C++ development environment

### Step 1: Compile object files
```bash
g++ -c stb/im_mat.cpp -o build/im_mat.o
g++ -c stb/mat_im.cpp -o build/mat_im.o
g++ -c Gussian/gussian.cpp -o build/gussian.o
g++ -c sobel/sobel.cpp -o build/sobel.o
g++ -c non_maximum_suppression/nms.cpp -o build/nms.o
g++ -c threshold/threshold.cpp -o build/threshold.o
g++ -c hysteresis/hy.cpp -o build/hy.o
g++ -c morphology/dilation.cpp -o build/dilation.o
g++ -c morphology/erosion.cpp -o build/erosion.o
```

### Step 2: Create static library
```bash
ar rcs build/libedge.a \
    build/im_mat.o build/mat_im.o \
    build/gaussian.o build/sobel.o \
    build/nms.o build/threshold.o \
    build/hy.o build/dilation.o build/erosion.o
```

### Step 3: Link and build executable
```bash
g++ main.cpp build/libedge.a -o edge_app
```

### Step 4: Run
```bash
./edge_app
```

## 🎯 Algorithm Pipeline

The Canny Edge Detection algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Gaussian Blur** - Reduce noise using a 3 by 3 Gaussian kernel
2. **Gradient Calculation** - Compute intensity gradients using Scharr operators
3. **Non-Maximum Suppression** - Thin edges by suppressing non-peak gradients
4. **Double Thresholding** - Classify edges as strong, weak, or non-edges
5. **Hysteresis** - Connect weak edges to strong edges
6. **Morphological Operations** - Refine edges with dilation and erosion

---

## 📊 Training Data

Each pipeline stage outputs intermediate results to `training_data/` as CSV files for analysis and debugging.

This allows you to:
- Visualize intermediate processing steps
- Debug algorithm behavior
- Compare results with reference implementations
- Understand the transformation at each stage

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Gaussian Blur
- **Kernel Size**: 3×3
- **Sigma**: Configurable (default: 1)
- **Purpose**: Noise reduction before edge detection

### Gradient Computation
- **Method**: Scharr operator (improved Sobel)
- **Output**: Gradient magnitude and direction
- **Precision**: Floating-point calculations

### Non-Maximum Suppression
- **Algorithm**: Directional edge thinning
- **Angles**: 0°, 45°, 90°, 135° quantization
- **Result**: Single-pixel wide edges

### Double Thresholding
- **High Threshold**: Strong edge pixels
- **Low Threshold**: Weak edge candidates
- **Ratio**: Typically 2:1 or 3:1

### Hysteresis
- **Method**: Breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS)
- **Purpose**: Connect weak edges to strong edges
- **Result**: Complete edge contours

## 📸 Sample Results

Place your input and output images in the `image/` directory:
- `image/input.png` - Original image
- `image/output.png` - Detected edges

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build errors
- Ensure `build/` directory exists: `mkdir -p build`
- Check GCC/G++ version: `g++ --version`
- Verify file paths match your directory structure

### Runtime errors
- Check input image exists in `image/` directory
- Verify image format is supported (PNG, JPG)
- Ensure sufficient memory for large images
